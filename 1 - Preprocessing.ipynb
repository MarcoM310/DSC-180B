As you have seen, while results are good, it can take a long time to train these models depending on the complexity of the task.  What if instead, you can for example, take a CNN trained to identify soccer balls in an image, and \"transfer\" its knowledge to a new task to identify basketballs in an image?  This is the core of the concept of transfer learning.  Transfer learning essentially entails training a model to perform one task, saving the model parameters and weights, then loading those saved weights as an initial starting point when training either the same or modified CNN for a different task!  https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning is a good reference\n","\n","Here, we will use the model developed by Dr. Kang Wang, one of the stellar T32 Residents who worked for Albert in around 2018.
